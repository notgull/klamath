Klamath
\end{center}

Klamath is an IWAD built for the Doom Engine. It revolves around the titular Klamath character fighting an evil corporation and its masters, and involves themes of urban warfare and fast-paced gunplay.  The goal is to take what's possible with the Vanilla DOOM Engine and create a more punchy experience using DeHacKeD.

\textbf{1). Playing the Game}

Klamath is just a WAD that requires a variant of the Doom Engine to play. This guide personally recommends GZDoom, as it is one of the most technologically advanced Doom source-ports and allows for easy modification of the game. However, Klamath should be compatible with any DeHacKeD-compatible source port, which includes the original Doom Engine from 1994.

\textbf{1.1). MBF-Compatible Source Port}

The DeHacKeD code is included as a lump in the Klamath WAD that an MBF-compatible engine can load automatically. Feel free to ignore the "klamath.deh" file, and run the following command:

"<source port executable> -iwad klamath.wad"

Where "<source port executable>" is the path to your executable, e.g. "gzdoom" or "prboom-plus".

\textbf{1.2). Chocolate/Crispy Doom}

Chocolate and Crispy Doom allow one to load DeHacKeD patches via a command line. If you want a more purist experience, run the following command:

"chocolate-doom -iwad klamath.wad -deh klamath.deh"

Replace "chocolate-doom" with the path to your Chocolate/Crispy Doom executable.

\textbf{1.3). Vanilla Doom}

If you just really want to run Klamath on the original Doom Engine, you first need to apply the DeHacKeD patch. Download the original DeHacKeD program, apply the patch, and run the Doom Engine using klamath.wad as the IWAD.

\textbf{2). The Story}

The year is 2020. Sixty years ago, Earth was invaded by aliens. Fifty-nine years ago, Earth was invaded again by aliens while the first alien invasion was still going on. Five poorly-scheduled alien invasions later, the resulting standoff lead to an uneasy truce, where they kind of agreed that everyone got the planet. A few decades later, mingling and interbreeding between the alien races and the humans have essentially integrated them into Earth's population.

You are Klamath, a private eye doing some investigation into the Zirconium Corporation, the world's leading producer of military-grade weapons, run by the Metal People. You have a hunch that they're doing something dastardlty. After digging through a few dumpsters, you find some documents that prove your hunch correct. They're building the Hummingbird Engine, a weapon of mass destruction intended to remove the non-Metal People from Earth, violently, by summoning some kind of army.

You go to the police and tell them about your findings, but they lock you up in the drunk tank. You guess you came across as a bit of a mess, given that they revoked your PI license after your last "hunch" led to the mall having to close down, so you decide to bide your time. However, you overhear the cops talking about you:

"So, what're we gonna do with Klamath?"

"Fry him. He knows too much about our little project."

"Aye aye."

Realizing that you've stumbled onto a conspiracy, you draw your pistol from a hidden compartment in your coat, shoot off the lock to your cell, and grab the nearest fire axe. As you ready yourself for a brawl, you hear the air sirens outside. A brief look tells you two things: the military has you surrounded, and your day's about to get a whole lot more bloody.

The documents you found indicated that the Zirconium Corporation intends to activate the Hummingbird Engine at 9 'o' clock PM. If they manage that, the death toll will be in the tens of billions. It's up to you to fight past the military, the police force, Zirconium's forces, and whatever else they can summon in order to save the world from utter destruction.

\textbf(3). The Weapons}

Klamath will wield a variety of weapons during his journey. They are enumerated below.

\textbf{3.1). The Fire Axe}

A melee weapon for when you've exhausted all other options. The Reno Fire Code says all buildings must have at least one fire axe, just in case there's a fire, so you should never be without this weapon. Fires slowly and does low damage, unless boosted with Steroids.

\textbf{3.2). The Pistol}

Your trusty pistol. You have it stowed away in a secret compartment of your coat, so even if you take a beating you'll still be able to take it out. Fires moderately quickly, but does low damage.

\textbf{3.3). The Sawed-Off}

The sawed-off shotgun is truly a beast to behold. It fires moderately quickly in a spread pattern that does more damage than the pistol. Useful for taking our low-tier enemies.

\textbf{3.4). The Submachine Gun}

A military-grade submachine gun, essentially a box that bullets come out of. Fires very quickly and does high damage, but will blow through your ammo very quickly. Useful in tight spaces when you're surrounded.

\textbf{3.5). The Scorcher}

A makeshift flamethrower that expels gasoline into a fire source to produce a napalm-like attack. Fires slowly, but does a high amount of damage.

\textbf{3.6). The Double-Barrel}
